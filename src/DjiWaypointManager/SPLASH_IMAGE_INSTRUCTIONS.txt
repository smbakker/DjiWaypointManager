# SPLASH IMAGE INSTRUCTIONS

## ?? Create Your splash.png File

To complete the splash screen setup, you need to create a `splash.png` file in this directory.

### ?? Recommended Specifications:
- **File Name**: splash.png (exactly)
- **Size**: 600x400 pixels (or 800x600 for higher resolution)
- **Format**: PNG with transparency support
- **Background**: Transparent or white
- **Content**: Your company logo, DJI drone imagery, or professional design

### ?? Suggested Content Ideas:
- DJI drone silhouettes
- Waypoint/mapping graphics
- Company branding
- Professional technology themes
- Aviation/flight themes

### ?? Once you add splash.png:
1. Place the file in the project root (same folder as this file)
2. Build and run the application
3. Your custom splash screen will appear on startup!

### ?? Note:
If splash.png is missing, the application will show a beautiful fallback design with:
- ?? Drone emoji
- "DJI WAYPOINT MANAGER" text
- Professional styling

The splash screen is fully functional even without a custom image!
